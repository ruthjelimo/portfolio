        <p>
            I am a sofware engineer with skills both in front-end and back-end and design skills<br>
            </br>.I am passionate about tech, since I believe that in tech no one is restricted one can explore<br>
            My career started wayback in the university where I did my bachelors of Computer science and   </br>
            In the next phase of my career, I not only want to use my design skills to make the application look beautiful, <br />
            but I also want to work on the technically challenging facets of the application too. At my ideal company, I would work on a small team<br/>
            that follows best practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming  
            to help me learn and grow as a developer
